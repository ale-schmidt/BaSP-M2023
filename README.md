## Week 04

On this week we were working on our responsive css files using and learning the flex box tool for the landing page we were working before.

For personal reasons and lack of time I could only work on some specific sections of the project. Also having in mind that I chose mobile and desktop resolutions considering both of them are the most diffrent meanwhile the tablet size is similar to mobile resolution.

## Week 05

This week we started a new process, we changed teams and put into practice everything we learned in week 5. The work modality continued to be individualy.

The weekly problem consisted in developing two additional screens on the project, the ones with forms, the login and the sing up.

The login section contains two fields, email and password, we had to do the validations of each one and make the link connections between HTML files.

For the sing up section, validations had to be performed for the fields Name, Last name, Date of birth, Address, City, ID card, Zip Code, Email, Password and Phone Number. All validations were made with javascript.
