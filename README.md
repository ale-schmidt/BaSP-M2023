## Week 04

On this week we were working on our responsive css files using and learning the flex box tool for the landing page we were working before.

For personal reasons and lack of time I could only work on some specific sections of the project. Also having in mind that I chose mobile and desktop resolutions considering both of them are the most diffrent meanwhile the tablet size is similar to mobile resolution.
